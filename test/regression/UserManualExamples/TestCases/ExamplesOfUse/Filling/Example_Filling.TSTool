# Data filling example - assume daily DateValue time series as input

# Generate some sample data for the example described above:
# ts1 has observed values from 1900-2000
# ts2 has observed values from 1920 to 1950 and regulated thereafter
#
# Although data are generated below, they could be read from files or a
# database.  In this case, the SetOutputPeriod() command might need to be used
# to ensure that the final result is for a required period.
