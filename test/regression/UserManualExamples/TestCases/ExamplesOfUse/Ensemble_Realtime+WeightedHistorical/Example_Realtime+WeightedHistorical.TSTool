# compute a weighted "best-guess" for the flows at lobatos for the remainder
# of the current year.  In other words, the current year will be complete,
# with observed at the beginning and historical "likely" at the end.

# First get the historic daily Lobatos gage and convert to traces.  Shift each trace to
# 2008-01-01 (the current year) so that the data can overlay the current year's

# After the above commands are executed, time series in memory will include the traces and

# OR select many time series and then disable/enable in the plot.  You may need to use
# both approaches to find appropriate time series to weight.
